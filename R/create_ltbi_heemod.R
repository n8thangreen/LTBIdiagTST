#' Create LTBI heemod model
#'
#' Create a heemod Markov model for the LTBI test population.
#' Transitions happen at the beginning of each year (equivalent to transition happening at
#' the end + ignoring the first year) with `method = "beginning"`.
#' Since with this method the first year is actually the second,
#' costs should be discounted from the start with the argument `first = TRUE` in `discount()`.
#' See: (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/d_non_homogeneous.html)
#'
#' @param age_init Starting age
#' @param pReact_comp TB after completed LTBI treatment
#' @param pReact_incomp TB after LTBI treatment drop-out
#' @param pReactB TB after no treatment
#' @param TB_cost Cost of TB treatment (Â£)
#' @param d Discount factor
#' @param N Number of runs; integer
#'
#' @return Returns a function with initial sub-populations as input.
