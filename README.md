The goal of LTBIdiagTST is to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis for
Latent TB testing for a range of tests and combinations.

The model is formed of a decision tree and Markov model components.
Probability sensitivity analysis (PSA) is a key part of this analysis.
The Markov model is implemented using the `heemod` package.
