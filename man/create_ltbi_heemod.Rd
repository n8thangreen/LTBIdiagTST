\item{TB_cost}{Cost of TB treatment (Â£)}

\value{
Returns a function with initial sub-populations as input.
}
\description{
Create a heemod Markov model for the LTBI test population.
Transitions happen at the beginning of each year (equivalent to transition happening at
the end + ignoring the first year) with method = "beginning".
Since with this method the first year is actually the second,
costs should be discounted from the start with the argument first = TRUE in discount().
